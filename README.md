# Weather app
### Description
I want to receive a notification about a current weather at the end of the lesson.
### Getting the weather forecast:
##### By city name at current moment:
- GET: **/weather/{city name}/current**
### About notifications:
I will get notification in my browser about weather at the end of the lesson.
Notification will show you current weather (temperature, wind, recommended outfit).
At this time app will remind you about weather at selection time intervals (GRSU timetable. Example: 8:30 AM , 9:50 AM).
