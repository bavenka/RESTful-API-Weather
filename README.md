# Weather app
### Description
I am a student and I want to receive a notification about a current weather at the end of the lesson for plannig future actions.
### Getting the weather forecast:
##### By city name at current moment:

- GET: **/weather/{city name}/current**

### About notification:
I will get notification in my browser about weather at the end of the lesson.
Notification will show you current weather (temperature, wind).
At this time app will remind me about weather at selection time intervals (GRSU timetable. Example: 8:30 AM , 9:50 AM).
